# Work-Day-Scheduler [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
This is a simple work day scheduler where the user can enter events on a time block and save that event. The UI consists of time blocks from the 9AM hour to the 5PM hour and is color-coded whether the hour is past, current, or upcoming. This is possible using the moment.js library.

The UI is dynamically rendered using jQuery. Saved events persist made possible using local storage.
